            <h2>Sketchbook</h2>
            <p>I carry this everywhere I go. Almost every day, I'm either in design class or at work, and it encourages me to be creative all the time. My sketchbook is my diary, with not just my process but also my thoughts as I navigate the design world. You never know when you'll get a jolt of inspiration.</p>

            <h2>Laptop</h2>
            <p>My laptop is my baby. It has my entire life stored in it, and I don't know what I'd do without it. From music to movies to design to social media, it's my window into the world and my favorite tool for notetaking and expressing creativity.</p>

            <h2>Headphones</h2>
            <p>These headphones are my favorite for some hardcore productivity. The plain ol' earphones can't compare to how easy I can get "in the zone" when I put these on. Whether it's today's hits, indie, EDM, or just white noise, I owe most of my ability to grind to these guys.</p>
