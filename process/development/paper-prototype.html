            <p>My first round of prototyping. My project has a very simple screen that is the main focus. It starts with a "begin" button and the music begins playing, the breathing ball begins undulating, and the audio visualization begins moving. I also had a "customization" panel on the upper right. This allows users to change settings regarding the visuals and sounds. You can change the type of music (rain, ocean, breathing, white noise) and also type of audio visualization (smooth or jagged). Ideally, the color could also be changed with a color bar. I got some critiques to have a "play" and "pause" button and have it be visible when hovering/clicking the ball. In addition, the "customize" panel might make more sense on the upper left, and should look more clickable/apparent rather than too hidden. I could also incorporate time for length of meditation.</p>

            <p>During my second round of prototyping, people mentioned that I should make users more familiar with the interface, in a subtle way. The play and pause button are hard to discover (require pressing/hovering to try it). Instead, I should have the button required to be pressed right after "begin." Thus, users would already be familiar with the play/pause function, as the icons only appear when hovered/actually pressed. I am still currently thinking about how the "begin" and "play" may be repetitive and redundant. Perhaps, I could remove "begin" and just have the "play" button. To have a user press "begin" and the experience not actually begin would take away from the intentional and emotional aspect of my design.</p>
