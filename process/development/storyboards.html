            <p>My storyboard begins with a stressed working man in a corporate setting. He craves an escape to meditate and relax, but he is surrounded by a very stressful and demanding environment. He also has anxiety sometimes because of his job, and wants to practice breathing exercises, maybe with some meditative music.</p>
            <p>This application provides the an immersive meditative experience to control and calm breathing through visuals and sound. By listening and concentrating on the sensations, we can work on our anxiety. This platform has audio visualizations and a undulating circle that encourages slow inhales and exhales. The goal is to help people, like this man, be more calmed and relaxed and ready to get back to work!</p>
