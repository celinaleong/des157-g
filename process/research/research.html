        <section>
            
                <p>After thinking more about my final project, I wanted to find a way to incorporate psychology into design for social good. An important project for me was managing “addictions,” from bad habits to addictive impulse-control disorders. I researched apps that encourage positive behavior and can help track negative addictive behaviors, along with the situations and emotions that are tied to them.</p>
            
                <p>I researched websites that detailed the purpose and capabilities that came with many addiction apps that are currently out. I thought it was particularly interesting to read about the ones that involved tracking your progress and recovery journeys (“Apps for Addiction Recovery and Mental Health”). Since most people who use the app would have already had an internal motivation to improve, we should continue to push on this motivation.</p>
            
                <p>Some apps also allow users to chat with other people. Some connect them to therapists, and some to support groups (“Apps for Addiction Recovery and Mental Health”). By speaking with people with similar issues, we can be encouraged to do more positive behavior. In addition, I read about apps that were location-based, and could thus provide a support group near you. Providing hotlines is also an essential part of this kind of app, as your user could be using it for anything from screen time to depression.</p>   
            
                <p>There are also journaling capabilities, and some apps can send daily check-ins to their users (Decapua). This can help with reminding people to be mindful of their activities and emotions. In addition, by keeping track of what we do and how we feel, an app can help us track triggers and their intensities. By rating the success of certain days and their activities, we can learn to associate situations and behaviors. This breaks down the idea of addition when we can find triggers that contribute to our stress and behavior. By gamifying these kinds of activities, users can be encouraged to do more positive behavior. This can involve giving a reward, yet making it not too negative if they fail to achieve it.</p>
            
                <p>Some apps also provide guided meditation, white noise, ocean/rain sounds, and other calming sounds to help with anxiety or just concentration. These apps are often based on cognitive behavioral therapy, where clients are invited to reshape their thinking to feel better (Decapua). We can begin by setting goals in what we do, and then share these goals with our family, friends, or healthcare providers.</p>
            
                <p>Much of these apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy. This kind of therapy can help with a variety of problems. It focuses on changing unhealthy thinking and negative learned behavior, and instead finding more positive ways to help us with our symptoms (What Is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). When we can change our thinking and emotions, we may able to change our behavior.</p>
            
                <p>When we find the root of our behavior, we can then control how we act. We need to know that we have control over ourselves and learn to become our own therapist. By encouraging people to be the drive of the change in their lives and, with help from a psychologist or health providers, thus be able to help themselves. The article ended with maintaining that cognitive behavioral therapy is about the “now,” the current life and not the past (What Is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). We need to focus on how we can be better moving forward, and and change our behavior based on that.</p>
