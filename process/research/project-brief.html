            <h3>Topic Summary</h3>
                <p>My project is based on audio visualization and visuals that encourage deep breaths to calm people’s anxiety and encourage a better mindset. The interface includes an undulating circle that people can follow as they inhale and exhale. The sounds are calming and meditative, and the audio visualization creates interest and immersion.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience Description</h3>
                <p>My target audience is people struggling from stress or anxiety who want methods to calm down. However, anyone can use this and I want it to accessible regardless of age, gender, demographic, income, etc. People who need it the most probably experience a lot of anxiety, and this is a way for them to slow their breathing and relax. Whether at the office, on the go, or at home, this application would be useful and portable.</p>
            <h3>Goals and Functionality</h3>
                <p>The user watches the audio visualization while listening to meditative sounds of their choice to slow their breathing and calm their mind. This allows for some reflective meditation and gives them an escape from the busyness and stress of everyday life. By watching the undulating circle, people can inhale and exhale slowly. Furthermore, the sounds create an immersive experience. The audio visualization creates interest and immersion. It will move based on the amplitude of the audio. Audio selections would be rainfall, ocean waves, morning birds, white noise, or none. There would also be a feature to drag in audio. If someone has their own favorite song, the audio visualization would work for that too.</p>   
            <h3>Visual Strategies</h3>
                <p>I want the interface to be very simple and minimal. I want the focus to be breathing and immersion, so distracting colors or features would take away from the experience. I am considering using a dark blue/purple gradient color scheme so that the main source of color is the undulating ball and audio visualization. Therefore, this can be the main focus. I’ve also considered using calming pastels like pinks and purples that evoke a relaxing sensation. However, this may suggest that this is for women only, which is not the case. I also want to use a simple typeface, probably sans-serif, to have a very modern and simple interface.</p>
            <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>The user would interact with this application on their phone or on desktop. I built it mobile-first because of potential ideal use cases. I want people to know that this is meant to be portable and is a way for people to find an escape wherever they are, whether in the office, on the go, or at home.</p>
