                <p>In recent years, Facebook created Facebook Fundraiser. This program is accessed within Facebook, which has already developed to be the largest social network. This allows the Fundraiser to take advantage of the platform to encourage donations within social circles and communities.</p>
                <p>Facebook Fundraiser has various categories of areas you can donate to. It displays an all-encompassing and thorough list that is easy to navigation. In addition, the page shows the current popular fundraisers at the moment to show other people giving back. When creating a fundraising project, users are able to not only select the cause (money for friend, organization, or personal cause), but they can also decide the end date of the fundraiser and the money goal amount. Facebook Fundraiser thus allows for a lot of customization for the users’ products.</p>
                <p>This program is also effective because it ties in so well with social media. A lot of people check Facebook every day. Facebook sends notifications about fundraisers to friends, and thus this drives interaction and views for the cause. It also incorporates birthdays. Users often use their birthday to encourage donations to a cause, and this is an easy way of getting friends in your circle to give to your choice of charity.</p>    
                <p>The user interface of Facebook Fundraiser is kept pretty simple and similar to the Newsfeed. By going for a similar look, the page gives off a sense of familiarity--users do not need to readjust to a new interface design. It is also very easy to access the various categories of charities, or to sort the causes based on category.</p>
                <p>Unlike uBack, Facebook Fundraiser only allows donating money, not time. However, the social aspect of the cause is extremely beneficial, and uBack does not have that. As humans, we are easily influenced by our friends and the people around us. Therefore, having their opinions and seeing their actions can encourage us to donate. Facebook successfully incorporated social networking in giving back to the community.</p>

            <h3>uBack App</h3>

                <p>uBack is an app that encourages people to give back to their community. Upon opening the app, it asks for your location. This app uses your location to find nearby causes that you can donate money to. It also has the option of donating your time, by volunteering hours.</p>
                <p>The app lists out the causes in the area, along with a donation page and a description. The app allows you to pick your favorite organizations and have those in their own column. In addition, by connecting to your employer, you can see the organizations they are connected to.</p>
                <p>Although I liked the goal of the app, it felt very incomplete and not well-kept. The description of almost every cause I looked at was blank. It was difficult to learn about what each one was about. It was probably hard to keep causes updated when there are so many. The user interface of this also made it frustrating. It was tiresome to navigate through all the causes, because the white text is always overlayed on an image.</p>    
                <p>Unlike Facebook Fundraising, uBack feels far more secluded. Even though the purpose of the app is to reach out to your community, it leans towards a “donate to feel better about yourself” experience. Even though you can donate time, the app feels very money-based and money-driven. Being able to see the money and time you spent volunteering may be nice to look back on, but also seems to encourage more of an entitled pat-on-the-back. People who would theoretically use the app are likely people who want to donate their time and money. However, most people who are incredibly motivated to spent time and give back do not need an app to encourage them. Especially when the app itself provides such little information, going to the organization’s own website would be far more helpful, taking away the purpose of the app.</p>
