            <br>
            <p><b>Bio:</b><br>Mia Wilson is a 25 years old woman working in Public Relations in Southern California. Her job is often high stress and does not give her much time to take care of her mental health. She likes to go to the beach to relax, meditate, and listen to the waves. It helps her slow her breathing and calm down.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Motivations:</b><br>
            Find ways to meditate without having to escape somewhere far<br>
            Use small breaks in her day to her advantage<br>
                Confront the difficulties in caring for mental health and professional/social/other obligations</p><br>
            <p><b>Frustrations:</b><br>
            There is too little time in the day to meditate<br>
                There arenâ€™t many platforms that encourage an immersive kind of meditation</p>
